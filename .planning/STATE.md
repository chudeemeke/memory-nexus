## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| bun:sqlite over better-sqlite3 | ABI compatibility issues with Bun; bun:sqlite is 3-6x faster | 2026-01-27 |
| Hexagonal architecture | User's WoW standard; clear layer separation | 2026-01-27 |
| Streaming JSONL parser | Session files can exceed 10,000 lines; memory exhaustion risk | 2026-01-27 |
| 12-phase comprehensive depth | Full vision delivery; not MVP-first approach | 2026-01-27 |
| FTS5 MATCH only | = operator causes full table scan; must enforce MATCH | 2026-01-27 |
| import type for ports | Domain purity - port files have no runtime dependencies | 2026-01-27 |
| AsyncIterable parser | Memory-efficient streaming for large JSONL files (10K+ lines) | 2026-01-27 |
| BM25 ranking default | Lower (more negative) scores indicate better relevance | 2026-01-27 |
| readline.createInterface | Node's built-in streaming for JSONL parsing | 2026-01-28 |
| Filter thinking blocks | Signature-protected content should not be extracted | 2026-01-28 |
| 1e12 timestamp threshold | Distinguishes Unix seconds vs milliseconds automatically | 2026-01-28 |
| Existence check for batch inserts | FTS5 triggers interfere with changes count; use SELECT before INSERT | 2026-01-28 |
| Batch size 100 hardcoded | Per CONTEXT.md decision; YAGNI on configurability | 2026-01-28 |

### Learnings

- Claude Code encodes directory paths (format: C--Users-Destiny-Projects-wow-system)
- Session files can grow to 10,000+ lines (10MB+)
- FTS5 MATCH vs = operator is a critical pitfall
- WAL mode requires checkpointing after bulk operations
- bun:sqlite has FTS5 enabled on Linux since v0.6.12; macOS may need workaround
- 20 distinct event types in JSONL files (see JSONL-EVENT-SCHEMA.md)
- Primary extraction targets: user, assistant, tool_use, tool_result, summary
- Skip: progress events, base64, file-history-snapshot (no semantic value)
- Subagent sessions stored in `<session-uuid>/subagents/` directories
- Events linked via parentUuid field for conversation threading
- BM25 returns negative scores; lower = more relevant
- Snippet extraction works on content up to 10KB+
- Bulk insert of 1000 messages with triggers < 5 seconds
- Real session discovery verified: 831 sessions found on dev machine
- readline.createInterface with crlfDelay: Infinity handles cross-platform line endings
- Thinking blocks are signature-protected; filter from assistant content
- Tool result IDs generated as `result-${toolUseId}` for linking
- Unix timestamp detection: values > 1e12 are milliseconds, <= 1e12 are seconds
- Windows path encoding uses backslashes in decoded form (C:\Users\...)
- Memory increase for 10K line file parsing: < 50MB with streaming
- FTS5 triggers cause cumulative changes count within transactions (bun:sqlite)
- Existence check workaround: SELECT id before INSERT OR IGNORE for accurate counting
- 1000 message batch insert: 163ms (well under 5s requirement)

## Session Continuity

### Last Session

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Completed:** Phase 4 Plan 02 (Message Repository with Batch Support)
**Next:** Execute Phase 4 Plan 03 (Tool Use Repository)

### Context for Next Session

1. Phase 4 execution in progress (2/4 plans complete)
2. Repositories implemented:
   - SqliteSessionRepository (04-01)
   - SqliteExtractionStateRepository (04-01)
   - SqliteMessageRepository (04-02) with batch support
   - SqliteToolUseRepository (04-03) - partially committed
3. Key finding: FTS5 triggers interfere with `changes` count in bun:sqlite
   - Workaround: use existence check before insert
4. Performance verified: 1000 messages in 163ms
5. 555 tests passing across all phases
